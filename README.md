## Overview

I'm on a quest to master C++ programming. This repository will document my learning process, from basic concepts to more advanced topics. You'll find a variety of resources, including:

- **Projects**: Small projects and applications built as part of my C++ journey.
- **Exercises**: Code exercises and challenges to solidify my understanding of key C++ concepts.
- **Code Samples**: Snippets of code that demonstrate specific programming techniques.

## Topics Covered

During my "Introduction to C++ Programming" course, I'll be exploring fundamental concepts, including:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (If-Else, Loops)
- Functions and Methods
- Arrays and Data Structures
- File I/O Operations
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
- Pointers and Memory Management
- Exception Handling
- and more...

I'll be documenting my progress as I dive into these topics.

## Projects

- [Project 1: Simple Calculator] (coming soon)
- [Project 2: To-Do List] (coming soon)

## Get Started

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and follow my progress as I delve deeper into the world of C++ programming.

Happy coding!
